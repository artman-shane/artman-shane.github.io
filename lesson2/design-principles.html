                        The concept of Visual Hierarchy provides the appearance of hierarchy or order to the visual.
                        It helps to direct the user's attention to specific area of focus, ordered without having the order 
                        forcefully defined as in an ordered list (numerical representation).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The developer has an order to the Lowes page by using size and colors:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The black area providing a 25% Discount</li>
                            <li>Brand recognition</li>
                            <li>Typical items of interest to visitors to the site/store like tools</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h2>Example provided by <a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Hick's law states that the more options or choices creates a sense of disarray and inhibits
                        consumer decision. Having too many options on the page will cause the user to forego any decision
                        at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of filtering will empower the user to limit the "field-of-view" to what is important to them
                        and allow easier decision of the options available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Etsy demonstrates this principle by organizing their options into a shortened list. Instead of placing
                        all options on the screen at one time, they keep the site limited helping the consumer of the site to
                        only see more options should they desire. You can see this with the "See more >" option at the bottom
                        of the page.
                    </p>

                    </picture>
                    <h2>Example provided by <a href="https://www.cabelas.com/product/Garmin-GPSMAP-reg-st/1813418.uts">Cabelas</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Fitt's law states that the size and proximity an object has to the target has coorelation to the time
                        it takes to move to the target. Further, mathmatical formulae can be applied to the effectiveness
                        of the target use when size and distance are modified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cabelas uses Fitt's law with their "ADD TO CART" large green button contrasted with their "Add To Wish List".
                        By leveraging Fitt's law, a consumer has an easier time of adding the item to the cart. Notice the proximity
                        of the target (Add to Cart Button) to the Sale Price just above the button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is my belief that having the "ADD" button closer to the image could be more effective. Having
                        it, both, at the top abd bottom of the item image/description would provide easier access. Maybe having
                        the button float with the image until you got to the description would even be more effective.
